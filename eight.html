	<p align="center">8 serves as 1's personal bodyguard and is voiced by Fred Tatasciore. In his time alone, he likes to get "high" off a magnet attached to his back. <br> 8 is a bully to anyone who opposes or threatens 1. He is not the brightest of the bunch, but usually puts up a good fight when the others are in trouble. <br> 8 is armed with a massive knife blade. He looks very similar to Oogie Boogie from Tim Burton's <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas.</em></p>
