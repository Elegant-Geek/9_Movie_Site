	<p align="center">5 is the "common man" who gets along with everyone. Voiced by John C. Reilly, he is a super kind soul and feels the most human out of the stitchpunks (in my opinion). <br> 5 tries to play the peacemaker and keep 1 pleased, but later stands his ground and becomes loyal to 9. <br> 2 was a mentor to 5 as they built things from the scraps left behind to them. 5 lost his left eye while escaping these massive war machines. Poor guy. <br> 5 is armed with a crossbow and has fantastic aim with just about any weapon.</p>
	<p align="center">In addition to playing peacemaker and defender, he is also a medic and a navigator. Bless him.</p>
