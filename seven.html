	<p align="center">7 is the sole female of the group and she is a super cool warrior. She's super tough and voiced by Jennifer Connelly. <br> She can't stand 1's tactic of hiding all the time. Rather, she prefers to take the offensive and fight to protect her friends. <br> 7 is armed with a large spear and protects her head with a bird skull helmet!</p>
	<p align="center">In addition to fighting off the beasts, she acts as a motherly figure to the twins. Go 7!</p>
