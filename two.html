	<p align="center">2 is the super friendly, intelligent, and brave old man of the group. Voiced by the late Martin Landau, he is the first one that meets 9. <br>He is an inventor at heart and is likely responsible for the majority of contraptions the stitchpunks use to navigate their world. <br> 2 is also a mentor to 5. He gets taken away by the awful catbeast, but not without putting up a fight first.<br> Shane Acker affectionately describes 2 as a "salty old dog." We love 2. And 2 loves everyone.</p>
