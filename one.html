	<p align="center">1 is the grouchy, self-proclaimed leader of the group. He is cunning and rarely indecisive (unlike me). <br> Despite his strong leadership, he tends to opt for "safer" options for the group. <br> He butts heads with 9 constantly. In the fandom, 1 is referred to as the Pope Doll because of his epic pope-like hat and other decorations. <br> Because he was created first, he is the oldest member of the group and has the most rudimentary design.</p>
	<p align="center">1 is pretty great. He's got a really cool character design. 
	<br> His eyes are super unique and has an oddly human face shape compared to the others.</p>
