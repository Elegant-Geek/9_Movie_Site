	<p align="center">3 and 4 are very interesting characters. They are inquisitive, childlike, and innocent. The twins are nearly identical with only very subtle differences. <br> They are designed from a pair of garden gloves (no joke) and can be found scurrying around the abandoned library in search of clues. <br> Originally, they were meant to share two halves of a "talkbox" which when put together, allows them to speak. Sadly, this concept was abandoned and they are mute characters.</p>

		<p align="center"> But they are still super cool! 3 and 4 communicate to each other by flashing their eyes. 4 is able to communicate via a projector to the others. <br> They don't add much to the plot, but hey, at least they're cute.</p>
