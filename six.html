	<p align="center">6 is the crazed artist and seer of the group. He originally was more of clairvoyant character who could see into the future, but was sadly reduced to an unintelligible outcast. <br> Despite this, 6 is able to alert the others to danger and the origins of their creation through his drawings and interactions with 9. <br> 6 has so many "Tim Burton" elements it's not even funny. He's got a neat striped canvas body, different-sized optics, wild unkempt yarn hair, and ink blotches everywhere. <br> The key around his neck belongs to a small jewelry box (this concept was scrapped unfortunately).  
	<p align="center">6 uses his pen nib fingers to draw all kinds of things, but mainly "the source" whatever that means...</p>
