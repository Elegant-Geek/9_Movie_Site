	<h3 align="center">About 9</h2>
	<p align="center">9 (2009) is a post-apocalyptic CGI film created by Shane Acker and produced by Jim Lemley, Tim Burton, Timur Bekmambetov and Dana Ginsburg. Shane Acker is an absolute genius. He developed the "ragdoll" concept and desolate world of 9 through an 11-minute student animated short in 2005. After getting some big names on board, he got the green light to turn the short into a full movie (90 minutes). Despite it's unbudging rating of 57&#37; on rotten tomatoes, it packs a solid cast (Elijah Wood, John C. Reilly, Christopher Plummer, and more) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eCxKhiGY0&list=PL2C3848AAAF489471&index=1">epic soundtrack</a> by Danny Elfman. This movie is almost <em><strong>12 years old already!</strong></em></p>
